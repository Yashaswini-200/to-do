        let text="Sampling gates are circuits that allow a portion of an input signal to pass through (like opening a gate to let some signal in). Theyâ€™re super handy in pulse circuits and analog sampling. In pulse circuits, sampling gates help control when a signal is allowed to pass, which is crucial for timing and synchronization. In analog sampling, they let you capture a snapshot of an analog signal at a specific moment, which is essential for converting it into a digital format. So, sampling gates are like the gatekeepers of signals, deciding when and how much of a signal gets through, making them essential for both timing in pulse circuits and capturing analog signals.";
